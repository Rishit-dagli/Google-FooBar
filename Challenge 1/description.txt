Write a function called solution(data, n) that takes 
in a list of less than 100 integers and a number n, 
and returns that same 
list but with all of the numbers that 
occur more than n times removed entirely. 
The returned list should retain the same ordering 
as the original list - you don't want to mix up those 
carefully-planned shift rotations! For instance, 
if data was [5, 10, 15, 
10, 7] and n was 1, solution(data, n) would return 
the list [5, 15, 7] because 10 occurs twice, and thus 
was removed from the list 
entirely.

Your code will run inside a Python 2.7.13 sandbox. 
All tests will be run by calling the solution() 
function.
Standard libraries are supported except for bz2, 
crypt, fcntl, mmap, pwd, pyexpat, select, signal, 
termios, thread, time, 
unicodedata, zipimport, zlib.

Input/output operations are not allowed.
