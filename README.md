# Google-FooBar

My solutions for Google FooBar.
These problems and my solutions to them might be quite 
helpful if you are preparing for a coding interview or are just interested in coding.

**Note: all these solutions are written in Python.**

I would strongly advise you to go over `Challenge 5`. I felt it was a real SOTA (state of the art) problem, seems very easy problem
