My solutions for Google FooBar.
These problems and my solutions to them might be quite 
helpful if you are preparing for a coding interview or are just interested in coding.

**Note: all these solutions are written in Python.**

I would strongly advise you to go over `Challenge 5`. I felt it was a real SOTA (state of the art) problem, seems very easy problem
while reading, hard when you try to code and the optimal solution is just a few lines (Here: <15 lines). You could read 
[my blog](http://datasets.rishit.tech/Blogs/A-SOTA-Coding-Problem/)
on this to geta better idea.

The decoded message I received-

```
"{'success' : 'great', 'colleague' : 'esteemed', 'efforts' : 'incredible', 'achievement' : 'unlocked', 'rabbits' : 'safe', 'foo' : 'win!'}"
